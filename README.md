# Electra

Electra is a modified version of the VADER algorithm that includes reverse-sentiment transformations for user-chosen emotional (VAD) categories, providing it with the ability to determine the implicit emotional contexts of many different conversational subjects. Electra performs much 
better overall compared to VADER alone, and provides an avenue for experimentation that could lead to an immense increase in accuracy for sentiment analysis algorithms.
